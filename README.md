# test_project_1

This project displays a shoe shop. It lets users click on shoes to add to cart and click to remove
from cart. On the cart page, the total is displayed.

To display the list, ListBuilder was used with a list of shoe names and a list of prices.
the "trailing" property was adjusted on the ListTile to add a shopping cart and a checkmark
when the item is in the shopping cart.

When the cart icon is pressed in the appbar, a new route is pushed showing a new list of saved
shoes. The total is displayed at the top.
